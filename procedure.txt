Instead of taking all correct samples (samples with all the attributes values) to finetune in incremental way ... 
.
we can also group samples based on attributes and then use those to predict missing labels. 

Strategy Breakdown:

1. Attribute Grouping:

A. Universal Attributes (Present in all/most categories):
* color
* pattern
* print_or_pattern_type

B. Upwear(tshirts)-Specific Attributes:
* sleeve_length
* fit_shape
* length
* sleeve_styling

C. Category-Specific:
* Sarees: blouse_pattern, border, pallu_details
* Tops & Tunics: neck_collar, surface_styling
* Kurtis: ornamentation, occasion

2. Multi-Stage Training Strategy:

Stage 1: Universal Attribute Training
* Pool all complete samples across categories for universal attributes
* Benefits Women Tshirts (258 samples) by leveraging:
  * Men Tshirts (4575)
  * Women Tops (4070)
  * Kurtis (1465)
  * Total pool: ~10,000+ samples for universal attributes

Stage 2: Group-Specific Training
* Train on "Tops Group" (Men Tshirts, Women Tops, Women Tshirts, Kurtis)
* Focus on shared attributes like sleeve_length, fit_shape
* Leverage larger complete datasets to help smaller ones

Stage 3: Category-Specific Training
* Fine-tune for unique attributes using only category data
* Use strong predictions from Stages 1 & 2 to expand training set

3. Progressive Data Expansion:

Phase 1: High-Confidence Expansion
* Start with universal attributes (color, pattern)
* Use pooled knowledge to predict missing values
* Threshold: 90% confidence

Phase 2: Group-Based Expansion
* Use knowledge from similar categories
* Example: Women Tops â†’ Women Tshirts for sleeve_styling
* Threshold: 85% confidence

Phase 3: Specialized Expansion
* Category-specific attributes
* Higher threshold (95%) due to uniqueness
* Manual validation for critical attributes

4. Category-Specific Strategies:

A. Women Tshirts (Most challenging):
* Primary focus on universal attributes
* Heavy leverage from Women Tops & Tunics
* Strict confidence thresholds for expansion

B. Sarees (Most unique attributes):
* Minimal transfer from other categories
* Focus on internal consistency
* Separate training pipeline for unique attributes

C. Women Tops & Tunics (Most complete):
* Use as primary knowledge source
* Validate transfer effectiveness
* Create attribute-specific confidence scores

5. Implementation Priority:

1. Universal Attributes First:
   - color (highest priority - universal)
   - pattern
   - print_or_pattern_type

2. Group-Specific Second:
   - sleeve_length
   - fit_shape
   - length

3. Category-Specific Last:
   - Based on category priorities
   - Higher confidence thresholds
   - More manual validation

6. Quality Control:

A. Confidence Thresholds:
* Universal attributes: 85%
* Group-specific: 90%
* Category-specific: 95%

B. Validation Strategy:
* Cross-category validation for universal attributes
* Group-level validation for shared attributes
* Category-specific expert validation

7. Risk Management:

A. Data Quality:
* Monitor attribute distribution drift
* Track cross-category consistency
* Validate attribute combinations

B. Model Confidence:
* Category-specific confidence thresholds
* Attribute-specific validation rules
* Regular manual sampling of predictions

This strategy maximizes the use of available data while maintaining prediction quality through careful staging and validation.
